The application of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology in the automated electronic environment for various functions including academics has widely been implemented by researchers. Automatic Access Control System using Students Identification Card based on RFID Technology This is an automatic access control system which was developed to curb unauthorized entry of people into a building and prevent uninvited people from gaining access to certain organization resources. The door locking system functions in real time, the door open as soon as the user scans the tag or card. The system has the ability to store the login and logout information of the user, so it can tell when a user is entering in or exiting the building. Each user possesses a unique tag or card and only that user is allowed to use the card. The main setback of this system is that once anyone has access to a card, then that person has access to the secured area.Radio frequency identification security access control system
